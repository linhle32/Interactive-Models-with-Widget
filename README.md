# Interactive-Models-with-Widget

This repository includes some examples of using IPyWidgets to build simple interactive applications over a trained machine learning model. For tasks that involve large models, for example, with text or image data with AutoModel from `transformers`, modeling codes will be reused from HuggingFace's tutorials which are noted so in the specific notebooks.
